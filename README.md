It includes the data and codes for implementing the PET simulation experiments of the paper "An accelerated preconditioned proximal gradient algorithm with a generalized Nesterov momentum for PET image reconstruction" authored by Yizun Lin, Yongxin He, C. Ross Schmidtlein and Deren Han.

Users only need to run the "Mainfile.m" to obtain the experimental results presented in our paper, including the reconstruction images of the Brain Phantom and Uniform Phantom, as well as the plots of normalized objective function value (NOFV) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).
